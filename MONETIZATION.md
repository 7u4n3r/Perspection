# Monetization and Services Around the Perspection Stack

This document describes ways labor, tooling, and services may be offered around the Perspection governance stack.

It does not modify the public domain status of the governance documents.
It does not grant ownership, exclusivity, or licensing rights over the stack.
It exists only to clarify where value exchange is appropriate.

## What is not monetized

The following are public domain and free for anyone to use:

- The governance stack documents
- The refusal taxonomies and categories
- The implementation examples
- The concepts and language contained in the stack

These materials may be used, copied, modified, and sold by anyone.
No permission is required.

## Where monetization is appropriate

Value can be exchanged for labor, judgment, and accountability.
Not for access to the ideas themselves.

The following categories describe legitimate paid work around the stack.

### 1. Audits and reviews

Time-bounded, scope-limited analysis of an existing system.

Examples:
- Refusal surface audits
- Notification and obligation language audits
- Threshold misuse analysis
- Drift analysis against stated governance claims

Deliverables are observational reports.
They do not confer approval, certification, or endorsement.

### 2. Implementation services

Paid work applying the stack to real systems.

Examples:
- Integrating refusal patterns into software products
- Rewriting copy to remove coercive or obligation-based language
- Designing observation-only dashboards
- Adapting the stack to specific domains such as healthcare, education, or AI tooling

Payment is for labor and execution, not for rights to the framework.

### 3. Tooling

Optional paid tools that implement or operationalize the stack.

Examples:
- Static site generators for governance references
- Internal tooling that tracks language drift without enforcing action
- Visualization tools for refusal types and thresholds

Tools may be licensed or sold.
The underlying governance principles remain public domain.

### 4. Education and writing

Teaching and explanation, not access control.

Examples:
- Books or essays explaining how to think with the stack
- Courses or workshops on identifying coercion patterns
- Case studies of real-world implementations

These do not restrict use of the stack itself.

### 5. Verification reports

Verification is not certification.

Examples:
- Independent assessments of whether a system matches its stated governance claims
- Public or private reports describing alignment, mismatch, and ambiguity

No seals, badges, or exclusive status are implied.

## What is explicitly not offered

To prevent misrepresentation, the following are not provided:

- Exclusive licenses to the governance stack
- Certification programs that grant authority over others
- Ownership claims over implementations made by third parties
- Enforcement of compliance

The stack does not govern people.
It governs itself.

## Boundary statement

Anyone may use the Perspection governance stack.
No one owns it.

Payment applies only to time, care, execution, and accountability brought to specific contexts.

If this distinction ever becomes unclear, the public domain status takes precedence.
