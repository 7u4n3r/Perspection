# Monetization and Services Around the Perspection Stack

This document describes how labor, tooling, and services may be offered around the
Perspection governance stack.

It does not modify the public domain status of the governance documents.
It does not grant ownership, exclusivity, or licensing rights over the stack.
It exists only to clarify where value exchange is appropriate.

## What is not monetized

The following are public domain and free for anyone to use:

- The governance stack documents
- The refusal taxonomies and categories
- The implementation examples
- The concepts and language contained in the stack

These materials may be used, copied, modified, and sold by anyone.
No permission is required.

## Where monetization is appropriate

Value may be exchanged for labor, judgment, and accountability.
Not for access to the ideas themselves.

### Audits and reviews

Time-bounded, scope-limited analysis of an existing system.

Examples include:
- Refusal surface audits
- Notification and obligation language audits
- Threshold misuse analysis
- Drift analysis against stated governance claims

Deliverables are observational reports.
They do not confer approval, certification, or endorsement.

### Implementation services

Paid work applying the stack to real systems.

Examples include:
- Integrating refusal patterns into software products
- Rewriting copy to remove coercive or obligation-based language
- Designing observation-only dashboards
- Adapting the stack to specific domains

Payment is for labor and execution, not for rights to the framework.

### Tooling

Optional paid tools that operationalize the stack.

Examples include:
- Static site generators for governance references
- Drift tracking tools
- Visualization tools for refusal types and thresholds

Tools may be licensed or sold.
The underlying governance principles remain public domain.

### Education and writing

Explanation without restriction.

Examples include:
- Books and essays
- Workshops and talks
- Case studies of real-world implementations

These do not gate access to the stack.

### Verification reports

Verification is not certification.

Examples include:
- Independent assessments of whether a system matches its stated governance claims
- Reports describing alignment, mismatch, and ambiguity

No seals, badges, or exclusive status are implied.

## What is not offered

The following are explicitly not provided:

- Exclusive licenses to the governance stack
- Certification programs that grant authority over others
- Ownership claims over third-party implementations
- Enforcement or compliance services

The stack does not govern people.
It governs itself.

## Boundary

Anyone may use the Perspection governance stack.
No one owns it.

Payment applies only to time, care, execution, and accountability brought to
specific contexts.

If this distinction becomes unclear, the public domain status takes precedence.
