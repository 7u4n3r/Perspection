# Engagement Principles

These principles apply to any paid or collaborative work conducted around Perspection.

They exist to preserve clarity, agency, and boundary integrity for all parties.

## Observation over control

Work is observational by default.
Recommendations may be offered.
Enforcement is not.

## No urgency framing

No timelines are imposed unless explicitly requested.
No language implying emergency, deadlines, or required action is introduced.

## No authority transfer

Engagement does not grant governance authority.
Clients retain full responsibility for their systems and decisions.

## Clear scope

Each engagement defines:
- A specific surface
- A specific duration
- A specific deliverable

Anything outside that scope requires a separate agreement.

## Public domain respect

The Perspection governance stack remains public domain.
Engagements do not modify that status.

If exclusivity, ownership, or restriction of use is required,
the engagement does not proceed.

## Right to refuse

Either party may refuse continuation if the work begins to violate
these principles.

No justification is required.
