# Services Around Perspection

Perspection is a public domain governance stack.
Anyone may use it without permission.

Some people request help applying it to real systems.
This document describes when that help may be offered as paid work.

## What these services are

They are observational and implementation-focused.
They do not grant authority.
They do not confer approval.
They do not create obligation.

Payment applies only to time, care, and execution.

## Governance surface audits

Short, bounded reviews of an existing system.

These focus on:
- Where language creates obligation
- Where notifications introduce coercion
- Where thresholds are misused
- Where stated values do not match actual behavior

Deliverable: an observational report.
No remediation is required.

## Implementation support

Hands-on work applying refusal patterns.

This may include:
- Refactoring copy and interface language
- Designing refusal-safe notification flows
- Implementing observation-only dashboards
- Translating governance principles into code or documentation

Ownership of resulting work belongs to the client.

## Tool development

Optional paid tools that make governance legible.

Examples include:
- Static reference generators
- Drift tracking tools
- Internal visualization systems

Tools may be licensed independently.
The Perspection stack itself remains public domain.

## Writing and education

Explanation without restriction.

Examples include:
- Books
- Essays
- Workshops
- Case study walkthroughs

These explain how the stack is used.
They do not gate its use.

## What is not offered

To avoid confusion, the following are not provided:

- Certification programs
- Exclusive licenses
- Enforcement or compliance authority
- Claims of “official” implementations

Perspection does not authorize.
It observes.

## Boundary

If a service would require restricting access to the stack,
asserting ownership over it,
or controlling how others use it,
that service is not offered.

Public domain takes precedence.
